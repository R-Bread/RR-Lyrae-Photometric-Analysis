# RR-Lyrae-Photometric-Analysis
A course project for PH 556 : Astrophysics.
We used astropy, sextractor, and APT to perform photometric analysis on an RR-Lyrae variable across spectral bands.
We then measured lightcurve periods via template matching, researched the period relations and estimated stellar characteristics.
